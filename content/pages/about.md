# Hi, I'm Harry

I am a full stack software developer. My speciality is creating enterprise
software solutions and my preferred languages are Javascript (especially React)
and Java. I don't just write code though, I build and maintain CI/CD pipelines,
create and maintain automated testing suites and enjoy providing mentorship for
my colleagues.

Across my career I have become proficient in a number of technologies including
(but not limited to):

- Javascript
- Java
- React
- Golang
- Docker
- Cypress
- Jenkins
- Mongo

## Recent projects

During lockdown here in the UK, I created an app so I could play _Names in a
Hat_ over video call with my family. It is a simple React application backed by
[Google firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). Head over to
[namesinahat.co.uk](https://namesinahat.co.uk/) to check it out!
